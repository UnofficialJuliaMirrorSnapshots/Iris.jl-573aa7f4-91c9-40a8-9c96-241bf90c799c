# To Do

* [x] fix αε in PML
* [x] Get working eig_kl
* [x] Get working eig_knl
* [x] Get working eig_cf
* [x] check PML normal incidence
* [x] check PML nonnormal incidence
* [x] boundary matching
* [ ] disperions: reorganize, two-level, kerr/chi-3
* [ ] relearn NLsolve, see if still best
* [ ] build single-mode SALT
* [ ] define SCPA through SALT
* [ ] floquet/periodic

In no particular order

* [ ] Add periodic (floquet) boundary conditions
* [ ] Band structure calculations
* [ ] SALT
* [ ] Saturable CPA
* [ ] Polar Coordinates
 * [ ] Nearest Neighbor shortcut in polar coordinates
 * [ ] Boundary Layers
 * [ ] Boundary matching
* [ ] Make nonlinear solvers use Pardiso/MUMPS
* [ ] Fix nonlinear contour solver with branch cuts, seek out only physical solutions
