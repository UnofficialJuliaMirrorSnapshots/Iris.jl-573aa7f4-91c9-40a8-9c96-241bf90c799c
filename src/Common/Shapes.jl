"""
    module Shapes

Definitions of various shapes.

All shapes have the signature: `shape(parameters::Tuple, x0, y0, Î¸=0)`, and some
have keyword argument `reference` which determines which point `(x0,y0)` is referring to.

The length of `parameters` depends on the shape. For example, `Circle` has just one
parameter, the radius, while `Ellipse` has two, the semi-major and semi-minor axes.
